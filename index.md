## About Me

Hi! I’m Hongrui Zhang, a first-year Ph.D. student in Materials Science and Engineering at Boston University. I’m passionate about leveraging computational tools and machine learning to solve complex science problems, particularly in advanced characterization and predictive modeling. With a master’s degree in MSE from Cornell University (and a minor in Computer Science) and a bachelor’s degree in MSE from Guangdong Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, I bring a strong interdisciplinary background to my research.

I’m currently looking for a lab that **accepts PhD students by summer 2025**. If you’re interested in collaborating or have opportunities available, I’d love to connect!

## Research Interests

- **Computer Vision:** physics-based convolutional neural network
- **Machine Learning:** Bayesian optimization, AI for science
