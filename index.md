## About Me

Hi, I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) at Boston University, and I am currently **looking for a lab that accepts PhD students by summer 2025**. I did my master's in MSE at Cornell University with a minor in Computer Science and my bachelor's in MSE at Guangdong Technion - Israel Institute of Technology.

## Research Interests

- **Computer Vision:** physics-based convolutional neural network
- **Machine Learning:** Bayesian optimization, AI for science
