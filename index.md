## About Me

Hi! I’m Hongrui Zhang, a first-year Ph.D. student in Materials Science and Engineering at Boston University. I’m passionate about leveraging computational tools and machine learning to solve complex science problems, particularly in advanced characterization and predictive modeling. With a master’s degree in MSE from Cornell University (and a minor in Computer Science) and a bachelor’s degree in MSE from Guangdong Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, I bring a strong interdisciplinary background to my research.

I’m currently looking for a lab that **accepts PhD students by summer 2025**. If you’re interested in collaborating or have opportunities available, I’d love to connect!

## Research Interests
- **Semiconductor Thin Film Characterization:**  
  Reflectance spectra, automated optical characterization system.
  
- **Computational Materials Science:** 
  Optical simuation of semicondcutor thin films.

- **Physics-Informed Machine Learning:**  
  Developing CNN models  to extract physical insights from experimental data.
